# HelpQuinnipiac---Group1
A user-friendly prototype was created to make it easier for Quinnipiac students to view the menu at Cafe Q on Main Campus. 
It can be annoying and time-consuming to look up the menu either by scrolling through the app, looking on QU Dining's social media, and/or the email that is sent.
With our protytpe all you have to do is type in the day of the week and the meal you are looking for, either brunch or dinner. 
After inputting the necessary information a list of ALL of your options are displayed, all in one place!
Every day the cafe offers the same brunch options, however it gives a different menu for dinner.
The user is also asked if they would like to view the menu for another day or another meal. 
If yes, the user is prompted to insert the necessary information again, day and meal type. 
If no, the latest menu viewed will be printed out again and the program will terminate.
